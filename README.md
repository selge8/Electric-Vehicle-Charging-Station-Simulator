# Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Station-Simulator
This project simulates an electric vehicle (EV) charging station for autonomous campus shuttles using discrete-event simulation and priority queue data structures.
# Project Objective
To determine the minimum number of EV charging stations required such that the average waiting time of all incoming shuttles does not exceed a user-defined limit.
# Key Features
Binary Heap Max-Priority Queue used for selecting the next shuttle to charge based on priority and arrival time.
Dynamically calculates the number of chargers required to meet a specific maximum average waiting time.
Simulates the minute-by-minute behavior of shuttles arriving, waiting, charging, and departing.
Displays detailed charging logs and average wait time after each run.
